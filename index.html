<p>Welcome TO FaekHax. FaekHax is an installer for the homebrew on Nintendo 3DS. 
But it doesnt use a primary or secondary exploit. It is more of a guide of an installer.
It has all the necessary files to launch the homebrew launcher. The full guide can be read in
the README.txt file in the folder. It all the executable, boot.3dsx, and including some
bin files which contain code for the ropbin and otherapp. The names of the bin file represent
the version of the 3DS. For example, OLD11.0.0-33.bin. When you find the right one with your\
version, just rename it too " otherapp.bin ". But the homebrew launcher itself was mainly created and currently
owned by Smea. You can find his page and credits to everyone else here: <a href="https://smealum.github.io/3ds/">https://smealum.github.io/3ds/</a>
